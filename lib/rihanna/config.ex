  Global configuration for Rihanna.

  Sensible defaults have been chosen for you but if you want, you can optionally
  override any of these values in your local configuration.

  For example, to change the table name for jobs:

  ```
  config :rihanna, :jobs_table_name, "awesome_jobs"

  In Postgres, advisory locks are scoped to a classid.

  Here we use a random classid to prevent potential collisions with other users
  of the advisory locking system.

  In the unimaginably unlucky scenario that this conflicts with a lock classid
  that is already being used on your system, you can change the classid that
  Rihanna uses here.

  The maximum number of simultaneously executing workers for a dispatcher.

  50 is chosen as a sensible default. Tuning this might increase or decrease
  your throughput depending on a lot of factors including database churn and
  how many other dispatchers you are running.

  How often the dispatcher should poll the database for new jobs (in milliseconds).

  Default is 100.

  Note that that actual poll interval in practice will be close to but not
  exactly this number of milliseconds for two reasons:

  1. A small amount of processing time for dispatching jobs is not included and
  will be added to the poll interval.
  2. A small, random amount of jitter is added to prevent multiple dispatchers started
  simultaneously from hitting the database at the same time.

  If you want to see Rihanna logs, set this config option to true.
